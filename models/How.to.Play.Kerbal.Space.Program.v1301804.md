## Choose Your Mode
 
Kerbal Space Program features three gameplay modes: Science, Career, and Sandbox. In Science Mode, you perform space experiments to unlock new technology and advance the knowledge of Kerbalkind. In Career Mode, you oversee every aspect of the space program, including construction, strategy, funding, upgrades, and more. In Sandbox Mode, you are free to build any spacecraft you can think of, with all parts and technology in the game.
 
You can choose your mode from the main menu when you start a new game. You can also switch between modes at any time by loading a different save file.
 
## Build Your Rocket
 
The first step to playing Kerbal Space Program is to build your rocket. You can do this in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) or the Spaceplane Hangar (SPH), depending on whether you want to launch vertically or horizontally.
 
You have access to an array of parts to assemble your spacecraft, each with their own function and properties. You can use engines, fuel tanks, command pods, wings, landing gear, parachutes, science modules, and more. You can also customize your rocket's appearance with decals, flags, and paint.
 
To build your rocket, you need to drag and drop parts from the parts list on the left side of the screen to the center of the screen. You can rotate and move parts by using the mouse wheel and the arrow keys. You can also use symmetry and offset tools to align and adjust parts.
 
One of the most important aspects of building your rocket is staging. Staging is the order in which parts are activated or separated during flight. You can set up your staging by using the staging list on the right side of the screen. You can add or remove stages by clicking on the plus or minus buttons at the bottom of the list. You can also drag and drop parts between stages to change their order.
 
You can test your rocket's stability and aerodynamics by using the center of mass (COM), center of thrust (COT), and center of lift (COL) indicators at the bottom left corner of the screen. You can also use the Engineer's Report button at the top right corner of the screen to check for any errors or warnings in your design.
 
## Launch Your Rocket
 
Once you are happy with your rocket, you can launch it by clicking on the Launch button at the top left corner of the screen. This will take you to the launch pad or runway, where you can control your rocket during flight.
 
You can use the WASD keys to pitch, yaw, and roll your rocket. You can also use the Shift and Control keys to adjust your throttle level. You can activate or deactivate stages by pressing the Spacebar key.
 
You can monitor your rocket's speed, altitude, fuel level, and other information by using the navball at the bottom center of the screen. You can also switch between different views by using the V key.
 
One of the most useful tools for launching your rocket is the map view. You can access it by pressing the M key. The map view shows you your rocket's trajectory and orbit around Kerbin or other celestial bodies. You can also use it to plan maneuvers, such as changing your orbit or transferring to another planet.
 
## Explore Space
 
The ultimate goal of playing Kerbal Space Program is to explore space and discover new things. You can do this by visiting different moons and planets in the Kerbol solar system, such as Mun, Minmus, Duna, Eve, Jool, and more.
 
To visit another celestial body, you need to perform a maneuver called a Hohmann transfer orbit. This involves burning your engine at a
